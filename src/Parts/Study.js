                    <h1> Higher education in Canada</h1>
                    <p>

                        Undergraduate degrees in Canada can take either three or four years to complete, depending on the university. Postgraduate degrees last between one and three years to complete, depending on the type of degree. Different types of higher education providers in Canada include: universities (which carry out research and provide both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees), community colleges and technical, applied arts or applied science schools (which grant certificates, diplomas, associate’s degrees and bachelor’s degrees).
        <br></br>
                As universities in Canada are managed by provincial governments, you’ll find there will be slight differences in how education is carried out. Quebec, in particular, is markedly different to the rest of Canada, with different term times and length of study. For instance, students finish secondary school a year early and must take a mandatory pre-university General and Vocational College (CEGEP) course, essentially eliminating the freshman year of university. Check with your chosen institutions for specific details.
